This assignment was to create and work with different implementations of the graph data structure. This was done by creating a graph over the values in a .csv file that included all the train stations in sweden and all their connections and the time each connection takes to travel. 

After creating a graph of all the cities and connections, the assignment was to find the shortest path between different cities.

Included in this folder is 3 different implementations of this task. The files for these implementations are Naive.java, Paths.java, and DynamicPaths.java. The other files are prerequisites for creating the graph of the cities and the connections.
When running the java file, use two cities as arguments to specify between which cities you want to find the shortest path.
