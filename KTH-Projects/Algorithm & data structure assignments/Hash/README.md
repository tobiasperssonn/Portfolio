This assignment was for us to create and work with different implementations of hashtables. This was done by creating hashtables for a .csv file that included all the Swedish zip codes and areas. Finally a bunch of test was performed on these hashtable implementations like lookups and collision tests, which can be found in the ZipTests.java file.

Every java file includes a different implementation of a hashtable.
