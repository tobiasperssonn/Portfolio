This is a project where a database was created and tested in the following 3 steps.

1.
Create a conceptual model of the database to start to determine what the database should contain from the customer requirments

2.
Create a ER diagram of the database, that now should represent how the final database should be structured. Also create two SQL scripts, one that creates the actual database as modeled in the ER diagram, and one that then fills up this database with a bunch of information and entries. 

3.
Perform various SQL queries on the newly created database, to insure its proper function and implementation
