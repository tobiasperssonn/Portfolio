This is a project of a dice, built with 9 leds, an Arduino, and a piezo sensor. The dice is controlled by movement in front of the piezo sensor, and is displayed with the leds.

To run this code, simply hookup the required components to the Arduino board, and then flash it with this code.

A Arduino Uno was used when developing and executing this code, but corresponding microcontrollers may work.
