This is a assignment where we created a program in assembly that counts the time second by second. This time was then compiled to C code and then displayed on a PIC32 microcontroller.

My work can be seen in the labwork.S file located in the time4mips folder. The other files mainly contain some prerequisites for compiling MIPS assembly code to work on a PIC32 microcontroller.
