This is a assignment where we created code to work with GPIO ports, and includes code to initialize i/O devices (leds and buttons), handle interuptions, and finally code for a timer. All this code is executed on a PIC32 microcontroller.

The time4int folder includes the code for handling interrupts
The time4io folder includes the code for communicating and using the i/o devices.
The time4timer folder includes the code for a timer that can be displayed on the PIC32 microcontroller.

The other folders and files contain prerequisites, and where given to us for this assignment.
