These are assignments, done both in C and Assembly, meant to show a understanding of working with computer on a low level. In lab 4, we even created the circuitry for a virtual CPU.
Every lab folder includes a readme file with information regarding each lab.

To run lab 1-3 you have to flash the code onto a PIC32 microcontroller, while lab 4 requires the program logisim.
